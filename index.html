    <h2>Aesop's</h2>

    <div class="main-content">
      <p>Aesop (/ˈiːsɒp/ EE-sop; Greek: Αἴσωπος, Aisōpos; c. 620 – 564 BCE) was a Greek fabulist and storyteller credited with a number of fables now collectively known as Aesop's Fables. Although his existence remains unclear and no writings by him survive, numerous tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this day. Many of the tales are characterized by animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have human characteristics.

Scattered details of Aesop's life can be found in ancient sources, including Aristotle, Herodotus, and Plutarch. An ancient literary work called The Aesop Romance tells an episodic, probably highly fictional version of his life, including the traditional description of him as a strikingly ugly slave (δοῦλος) who by his cleverness acquires freedom and becomes an adviser to kings and city-states. Older spellings of his name have included Esop(e) and Isope. Depictions of Aesop in popular culture over the last 2500 years have included many works of art and his appearance as a character in numerous books, films, plays, and television programs.

    <h2>The Lion And The Mouse</h2>

    <div class="main-content">
      <p>A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising
  up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse
  piteously entreated, saying: “If you would only spare my life, I would
  be sure to repay your kindness.” The Lion laughed and let him go. It
  happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters,
  who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing
  his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free,
  exclaiming:

  “You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting
  to receive from me any repayment of your favor; now you know that it is
  possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.”</p>

    <h2>The Hare and the Tortoise</h2>

    <div class="main-content">
      <p>A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise,
      who replied, laughing: “Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you
      in a race.” The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible,
      assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose
      the course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two
      started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on
      with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare,
      lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and
      moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal,
      and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.

      Slow but steady wins the race.</p>

    <h2>The Flies and the Honey-Pot</h2>

    <div class="main-content">
      <p>A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been
      overturned in a housekeeper’s room, and placing their feet in it, ate
      greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that
      they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were
      suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, “O foolish
      creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have
      destroyed ourselves.”

      Pleasure bought with pains, hurts.</p>

    <h2>The Geese and the Cranes</h2>

    <div class="main-content">
      <p>  THE GEESE and the Cranes were feeding in the same meadow, when a
        birdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets. The Cranes, being light of
        wing, fled away at his approach; while the Geese, being slower of flight
        and heavier in their bodies, were captured.</p>

    <h2>The Oak and the Reeds</h2>

    <div class="main-content">
      <p> A VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a stream. It
      fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed: “I wonder how you, who
      are so light and weak, are not entirely crushed by these strong winds.”
       They replied, “You fight and contend with the wind, and consequently you
      are destroyed; while we on the contrary bend before the least breath of
      air, and therefore remain unbroken, and escape.”

      Stoop to conquer.</p>
