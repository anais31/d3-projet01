    <p>A VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a stream. It
    fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed: “I wonder how you, who
    are so light and weak, are not entirely crushed by these strong winds.”
     They replied, “You fight and contend with the wind, and consequently you
    are destroyed; while we on the contrary bend before the least breath of
    air, and therefore remain unbroken, and escape.”

    Stoop to conquer.</p>
