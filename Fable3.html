    <p>A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been
    overturned in a housekeeper’s room, and placing their feet in it, ate
    greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that
    they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were
    suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, “O foolish
    creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have
    destroyed ourselves.”

    Pleasure bought with pains, hurts.</p>
